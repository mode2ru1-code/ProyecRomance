> A decentralized, privacy-focused browser built on a custom protocol. Reclaiming the internet, one line of code at a time.

ProyecRomance isn't just a browser; it's an exploration into digital sovereignty. In a world dominated by centralized platforms, this project is a statementâ€”a romance with the pure, untamed potential of a truly private web.

## Core Philosophy

- **Absolute Privacy:** No trackers, no telemetry, no compromises. Your data is yours alone.
- **Decentralized by Design:** Built on a custom protocol (`blabla://`) and a user-defined naming system.
- **Open & Transparent:** Every line of code is open for scrutiny. This is security through transparency, not obscurity.
- **Developer-First:** Built by a purist, for purists.

## High-Level Architecture

Here's a simplified look at how the ecosystem is designed to work:

```

|                   |      |                     |      |                   |
+-------------------+      +---------------------+      +-------------------+

       |                                                        |
       +------------------- blabla:// protocol -----------------+
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Phase 1: The Core Protocol** - Define and implement the `blabla://` protocol.
